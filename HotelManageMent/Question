Design the backend system for a Hotel Management System that handles the following core functionalities:

-Room booking (check availability, make reservations, cancel bookings).
-Customer management (register, update details, view history).
-Staff management (add staff, assign roles, schedule shifts).
-Payment processing (accept payments, refunds).
-Inventory management (track available rooms, maintenance, etc.).



Consider the following:

-The system should be able to handle multiple hotels.
-The design should focus on scalability, clean data models, and efficient interactions between components.
-Describe how the system would handle key use cases like booking a room and processing payments.


Follow-up:
Explain the class diagram, including key entities like Hotel, Room, Reservation, Customer, etc.
Discuss how you would handle concurrency for room bookings.
How would you structure the database schema for bookings, payments, and customer management?
Feel free to start with a high-level approach and we can zoom into specific components as needed.
